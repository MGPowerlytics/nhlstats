GMAIL APP PASSWORD SETUP INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

To allow Airflow to send emails via your Gmail account, you need to create an App Password:

1. Go to your Google Account: https://myaccount.google.com/
2. Select "Security" in the left navigation
3. Under "How you sign in to Google," select "2-Step Verification" (you must have this enabled)
4. At the bottom, select "App passwords"
5. Click "Select app" and choose "Mail"
6. Click "Select device" and choose "Other (Custom name)"
7. Enter "Airflow Betting System"
8. Click "Generate"
9. Copy the 16-character password (it will look like: "abcd efgh ijkl mnop")

IMPORTANT: Save this password - you'll need to add it to the .env file

Once you have the password, create a file called '.env' in the project root with:
GMAIL_USER=your.email@gmail.com
GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop  # (no spaces)
