## 📊 Bet Type Definitions

### 1. **Moneyline** (ML)
Straight-up winner bet. No point spread.
- **Favorite**: Negative odds (e.g., -150 means bet $150 to win $100)
- **Underdog**: Positive odds (e.g., +130 means bet $100 to win $130)

### 2. **Point Spread / Puck Line**
Handicap betting - favorite must win by X points, underdog can lose by less than X.
- **Example**: Lakers -4 means Lakers must win by 5+ points
- **NHL uses 1.5 goal spread** (called puck line)

### 3. **Over/Under (Totals)**
Bet on combined score of both teams.
- **Over**: Total score > line
- **Under**: Total score < line

### 4. **Parlays**
Combine multiple bets - all must win for payout.
- Higher risk, higher reward
- Example: 3-leg parlay at +600 means $100 bet wins $600

### 5. **Prop Bets**
Bet on specific events within game.
- Player props: Points, rebounds, goals, saves
- Team props: First to score, halftime leader
- Game props: Longest touchdown, etc.

## 💡 Advanced Betting Concepts

### 1. Line Shopping
**Same bet, different books:**
| Book | Lakers Spread | Odds |
|------|---------------|------|
| FanDuel | -4 | -110 |
| DraftKings | -3.5 | -115 |
| BetMGM | -4.5 | -105 |

**Strategy**: Shop for best number (0.5 points matters!)

---

### 2. Live Betting Example
**NBA Game: Lakers vs. Hornets**

**Pre-game**: Lakers -4 (-110)

**Live at Halftime** (Lakers up 8):
- Lakers now -8.5 (-110)
- Hornets +8.5 (-110)
- **Middle opportunity**: Bet Hornets +8.5, if Lakers win by 5-7, both bets win!

---

### 3. Arbitrage Example
**Rare but possible:**
- **Book A**: Rams -3.5 (-105)
- **Book B**: Bears +4.5 (-110)

**Bet both:**
- $105 on Rams -3.5
- $110 on Bears +4.5
- **Total risk**: $215
- **Guaranteed win**: If Rams win by exactly 4, BOTH bets win
- Otherwise one bet wins (~$100), net loss minimal

---

### 4. Hedging Example
**Scenario**: You bet $100 on Bills to win Super Bowl at +1200 (win $1,200).
Bills make it to Super Bowl vs. Eagles.

**Super Bowl Line**: Eagles -3

**Hedge Strategy:**
- Bet $400 on Eagles ML
- **If Bills win**: Win $1,200 - $400 = +$800
- **If Eagles win**: Win $320 on hedge, lose $100 original = +$220
- **Guaranteed profit either way**

---

### 5. Correlation in Same Game Parlays
**Smart Correlation:**
✅ Lakers ML + Over (if Lakers win big, total likely high)
✅ LeBron 30+ points + Lakers -4 (his scoring helps spread)

**Poor Correlation:**
❌ Under + Player to score 40+ (contradictory)
❌ Team ML + Opponent player props (opposing interests)

## 📈 How Smart Contracts Could Handle These

### Example 1: Simple Moneyline
```solidity
// Warriors ML vs. Knicks
function placeBet(uint8 team) external payable {
    require(team == WARRIORS || team == KNICKS);
    // Warriors: -250 (implied 71.4% probability)
    // Knicks: +215 (implied 31.7% probability)
}
```

### Example 2: Spread Betting
```solidity
struct SpreadBet {
    address bettor;
    uint8 team;
    int8 spread; // -6.5 for Warriors
    uint256 amount;
}

function declareWinner(uint8 winner, int8 margin) external {
    // If Warriors -6.5 and they win by 8, Warriors spread bets win
    // If they win by 5, Knicks spread bets win
}
```

### Example 3: Player Props
```solidity
struct PlayerProp {
    string playerName;
    uint256 line; // e.g., 26.5 points
    bool isOver;
}

// Oracle reports: LeBron scored 31 points
function settlePlayerProp(string memory player, uint256 actualValue) external {
    // All "Over 26.5" bets win
    // All "Under 26.5" bets lose
}
```

### Example 4: Parlay
```solidity
struct Parlay {
    address bettor;
    uint256 amount;
    uint256[] gameIds;
    uint8[] selections;
    bool settled;
}

function settleParlays() external {
    // All legs must win for payout
    // If any leg loses, entire parlay loses
}
```

## 🔢 Odds Conversion Reference

### American to Probability
```python
def american_to_probability(odds):
    if odds < 0:  # Favorite
        return abs(odds) / (abs(odds) + 100)
    else:  # Underdog
        return 100 / (odds + 100)

# Examples:
# -250 → 71.4%
# +215 → 31.7%
# -110 → 52.4%
```

### Probability to American
```python
def probability_to_american(prob):
    if prob > 0.5:  # Favorite
        return -1 * (prob / (1 - prob)) * 100
    else:  # Underdog
        return ((1 - prob) / prob) * 100

# Examples:
# 65% → -186
# 35% → +186
# 50% → +100
```

### Implied Probability vs. True Probability
```
Book offers: Lakers -4 at -110 (52.4% implied)
Your model says: Lakers 60% to cover -4
Edge = 60% - 52.4% = 7.6% (+EV bet!)
```
